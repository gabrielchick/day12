<!-- This HTML is a simple template for displaying weather information for a specific city, using dynamic data rendered by a backend templating engine (e.g., Thymeleaf). Here's what it achieves:

Dynamic City Display:

The <span data-th-text="${city}"></span> element dynamically displays the name of the city for which the weather data is shown. The ${city} variable is populated by the backend.
Dynamic Unit of Measurement:

The <span data-th-text="${unit}"></span> element displays the unit of measurement (e.g., metric or imperial) used for the weather data. The ${unit} variable is also populated by the backend.
Purpose:
This template serves as a simple and clean way to present the weather information for a given city in a specified unit. By dynamically injecting city and unit data, it ensures flexibility and reusability across various cities and measurement preferences. -->
