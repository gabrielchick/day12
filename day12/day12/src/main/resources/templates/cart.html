<!-- This HTML is designed to display a user's shopping cart dynamically, with content tailored to the user's shopping data. The page is built to integrate with a backend framework that utilizes a templating engine (e.g., Thymeleaf) to render data passed from the server. Here's the overall explanation:

Page Title and Heading:

The title of the page is "Cart," displayed on the browser tab.
The heading <h1>My Shopping Cart</h1> introduces the main purpose of the page.
Greeting the User:

The Hello <span data-th-text="${name}"></span> element dynamically displays the user's name using server-rendered data.
Conditional Messaging:

Two <div> blocks display different messages based on the count variable passed from the backend:
If count > 10, a thank-you message is displayed.
Otherwise, a prompt asking if the user has everything they need is shown.
Table for Cart Items:

A table lists the shopping cart items, with headers for "Item" and "Quantity."
Inside the <tbody>, a loop (data-th-each) iterates over a collection of items (items) passed from the server.
Each item's index, name, and quantity are dynamically inserted into the table cells using data-th-text.
Navigation:

A link at the bottom (<a href="/">) takes the user back to the homepage, labeled with a clickable heading "Back."
Purpose:
The HTML leverages dynamic data rendering to personalize the shopping cart display for the user.
The integration of a backend templating engine ensures that data (e.g., user name, item details) is
seamlessly populated into the structure. This design supports clear communication and intuitive navigation
for an online shopping experience. -->
